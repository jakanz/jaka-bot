# Introduction
jakabot is a currently running project run by jakanz. jakabot is currently, as of June 2021, in a very developmental and experimental stage. Please expect some bugs and slow runtimes.

I'm hoping to complete this project by the end of next year, however due to the lack of skill to maintain a schedule and keep motivated, expect development to be very up and down. This may cause bugs to linger in the code for a long while, but be patient.

## "I think I found your bot token..."
The bot token found in my previous commits to this repository **is no longer valid** (for obvious reasons). Go ahead, try it. **It won't work.** The new bot token is linked to a separate JSON file **(seen in ```index.js```)**, so it's not possible to get my token anymore.
