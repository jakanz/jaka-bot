# Introduction

jakabot is a currently running project run by jakanz. jakabot is currently, as of April 2022, in a developmental and experimental stage. Please expect some bugs and slow runtimes.

I'm hoping to complete a majority of this project by the end of next year, however due to the lack of a schedule and motivation, expect development to be very up and down. This may cause bugs to linger in the code for a long while, but be patient.

## "I think I found your bot token..."

The bot token found in my previous commits to this repository **is no longer valid** (for obvious reasons). The new bot token is linked separately to config.json **(seen in ```index.js```)**, which does not exist in this repository.
